# Semantic Emoji Prediction for Social Media

This project predicts semantic emoji categories from tweet text using a BiLSTM model with an attention mechanism.

Emojis are grouped into five categories: Love, Hype, Gesture, Emotion, and Celebrate to reduce class imbalance and improve interpretability.

The project includes dataset preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a final research paper.
